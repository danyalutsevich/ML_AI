INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING
A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It's
about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, there's a
healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and
eating eggs.
Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young
Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow
countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style.
It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old
she is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy
and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid-
pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.
                       YOUNG MAN
           No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through
           doin' that shit.
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           You always say that, the same thing every
           time: never again, I'm through, too
           dangerous.
                       YOUNG MAN
           I know that's what I always say. I'm
           always right too, but –
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           – but you forget about it in a day or two
           –
                       YOUNG MAN
           – yeah, well, the days of me forgittin'
           are over, and the days of me rememberin'
           have just begun.
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           When you go on like this, you know what
           you sound like?
                       YOUNG MAN
           I sound like a sensible fucking man, is
           what I sound like.
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           You sound like a duck.
                    (imitates a duck)
           Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
           quack...
                       YOUNG MAN
           Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna
           hafta hear it again. Because since I'm
           never gonna do it again, you're never
           gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm
           never gonna do it again.
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           After tonight.
The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there,
back and forth.
                       YOUNG MAN
                    (with a smile)
           Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.
                       WAITRESS
           Can I get anybody anymore coffee?
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           Oh yes, thank you.
The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man lights
up another cigarette.
                       YOUNG MAN
           I'm doin' fine.
The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke.
The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee.
The Young Man goes right back into it.
                       YOUNG MAN
           I mean the way it is now, you're takin'
           the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a
           bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are
           easier! Federal banks aren't supposed to
           stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're
           insured, why should they care? You don't
           even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard
           about this guy, walked into a federal bank
           with a portable phone, handed the phone to
           the teller, the guy on the other end of
           the phone said: "We got this guy's little
           girl, and if you don't give him all your
           money, we're gonna kill 'er."
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           Did it work?
            YOUNG MAN
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank
with a telephone, not a pistol, not a
shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the
place out, and they don't lift a fuckin'
finger.
            YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?
            YOUNG MAN
I don't know. There probably never was a
little girl – the point of the story isn't
the little girl. The point of the story is
they robbed the bank with a telephone.
            YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?
            YOUNG MAN
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just
illustrating that if we did, it would be
easier than what we been doin'.
            YOUNG WOMAN
So you don't want to be a bank robber?
            YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin' down the
same road, either dead or servin' twenty.
            YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?
            YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about? Yeah, no-
more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the
giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own
liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they
can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
"Empty out the register," and they don't
know what it fuckin' means. They make it
too personal. We keep on, one of those
gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill
'em.
            YOUNG WOMAN
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
                         YOUNG MAN
              I don't wanna kill anybody either. But
              they'll probably put us in a situation
              where it's us of them. And if it's not the
              gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the
              store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya
              got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
              counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin'
              into one of those stores with nothin' but
              a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck
              it, forget it, we're out of it.
                          YOUNG WOMAN
              Well, what else is there, day jobs?
                          YOUNG MAN
                       (laughing)
              Not this life.
                          YOUNG WOMAN
              Well what then?
He calls to the Waitress.
                          YOUNG MAN
              Garcon! Coffee!
Then looks to his girl.
                            YOUNG MAN
              This place.
The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.
                          WAITRESS
                       (snotty)
              "Garcon" means boy.
She splits.
                          YOUNG WOMAN
              Here? It's a coffee shop.
                          YOUNG MAN
              What's wrong with that? People never rob
              restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores,
              gas stations, you get your head blown off
              stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on
              the other hand, you catch with their pants
              down. They're not expecting to get robbed,
              or not as expecting.
                          YOUNG WOMAN
                       (taking to idea)
              I bet in places like this you couldcut
              down on the hero factor.
                      YOUNG MAN
           Correct. Just like banks, these places are
           insured. The managers don't give a fuck,
           they're just tryin' to get ya out the door
           before you start pluggin' diners.
           Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a
           bullet for the register. Busboys, some
           wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
           gonna really give a fuck you're stealin'
           from the owner. Customers are sittin'
           there with food in their mouths, they
           don't know what's goin' on. One minute
           they're havin' a Denver omelette, next
           minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their
           face.
The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man continues
in a low voice.
                       YOUNG MAN
           See, I got the idea last liquor store we
           stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept
           comin' in?
                         YOUNG WOMAN
           Yeah.
                       YOUNG MAN
           They you got the idea to take everybody's
           wallet.
                         YOUNG WOMAN
           Uh-huh.
                       YOUNG MAN
           That was a good idea.
                         YOUNG WOMAN
           Thanks.
                       YOUNG MAN
           We made more from the wallets then we did
           the register.
                         YOUNG WOMAN
           Yes we did.
                       YOUNG MAN
           A lot of people go to restaurants.
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           A lot of wallets.
                       YOUNG MAN
           Pretty smart, huh?
The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new information.
She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The tires
WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the motions,
collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the COOK about
something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's face.
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           Pretty smart.
                    (into it)
           I'm ready, let's go, right here, right
           now.
                       YOUNG MAN
           Remember, same as before, you're crowd
           control, I handle the employees.
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           Got it.
They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on the
table. He looks at her and she back at him.
                       YOUNG WOMAN
           I love you, Pumpkin.
                       YOUNG MAN
           I love you, Honey Bunny.
And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand
up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona is that of
the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is that of the
psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.
                       PUMPKIN
                    (yelling to all)
           Everybody be cool this is a robbery!
                       HONEY BUNNY
           Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll
           execute every one of you motherfuckers!
           Got that?

"PULP FICTION"
INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING
An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down a
homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front seat are two
young fellas – one white, one black – both wearing cheap black
suits with thin black ties under long green dusters. Their names
are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD (black). Jules is
behind the wheel.
                       JULES
           – Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?
            VINCENT
What so you want to know?
            JULES
Well, hash is legal there, right?
            VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred
percent legal. I mean you can't walk into
a restaurant, roll a joint, and start
puffin' away. You're only supposed to
smoke in your home or certain designated
places.
            JULES
Those are hash bars?
            VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal
to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if
you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's
legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it,
which doesn't really matter 'cause – get a
load of this – if the cops stop you, it's
illegal for this to search you. Searching
you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam
don't have.
            JULES
That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin',
that's all there is to it.
            VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know what
the funniest thing about Europe is?
            JULES
What?
            VINCENT
It's the little differences. A lotta the
same shit we got here, they got there, but
there they're a little different.
            JULES
Examples?
            VINCENT
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a
movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper
cup either. They give you a glass of beer,
like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer
at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they
call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in
Paris?
            JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese?
                       VINCENT
           No, they got the metric system there, they
           wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter
           Pounder is.
                       JULES
           What'd they call it?
                       VINCENT
           Royale with Cheese.
                       JULES
                    (repeating)
           Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big
           Mac?
                       VINCENT
           Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le
           Big Mac.
                       JULES
           Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?
                       VINCENT
           I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.
           But you know what they put on french fries
           in Holland instead of ketchup?
                         JULES
           What?
                         VINCENT
           Mayonnaise.
                         JULES
           Goddamn!
                       VINCENT
           I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a
           little bit on the side of the plate, they
           fuckin' drown 'em in it.
                         JULES
           Uuccch!
                                                      CUT TO:
INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING
The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach inside,
taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking them.
                       JULES
           We should have shotguns for this kind of
           deal.
                       VINCENT
           How many up there?
                       JULES
           Three or four.
                       VINCENT
           Counting our guy?
                       JULES
           I'm not sure.
                       VINCENT
           So there could be five guys up there?
                       JULES
           It's possible.
                       VINCENT
           We should have fuckin' shotguns.
They CLOSE the trunk.
                                                      CUT TO:
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what looks
like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.
We TRACK alongside.
                       VINCENT
           What's her name?
                        JULES
           Mia.
                       VINCENT
           How did Marsellus and her meet?
                       JULES
           I dunno, however people meet people. She
           usta be an actress.
                       VINCENT
           She ever do anything I woulda saw?
                       JULES
           I think her biggest deal was she starred
           in a pilot.
                       VINCENT
           What's a pilot?
                       JULES
           Well, you know the shows on TV?
                       VINCENT
           I don't watch TV.
                       JULES
           Yes, but you're aware that there's an
           invention called television, and on that
           invention they show shows?
                          VINCENT
           Yeah.
                       JULES
           Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is
           they make one show, and that show's called
           a pilot. And they show that one show to
           the people who pick the shows, and on the
           strength of that one show, they decide if
           they want to make more shows. Some get
           accepted and become TV programs, and some
           don't, and become nothing. She starred in
           one of the ones that became nothing.
They enter the apartment building.
INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING
Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait for the
elevator.
                       JULES
           You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-black,
           half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky
           Horror.
                       VINCENT
           Yeah maybe, fat right?
                       JULES
           I wouldn't go so far as to call the
           brother fat. He's got a weight problem.
           What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan.
                       VINCENT
           I think I know who you mean, what about
           him?
                       JULES
           Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good.
           And word around the campfire, it was on
           account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
The elevator arrives, the men step inside.
INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING
                       VINCENT
           What'd he do, fuck her?
                       JULES
           No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad.
                      VINCENT
           Well what then?
                       JULES
           He gave her a foot massage.
                       VINCENT
           A foot massage?
Jules nods his head: "Yes."
                         VINCENT
           That's all?
Jules nods his head: "Yes."
                       VINCENT
           What did Marsellus do?
                       JULES
           Sent a couple of guys over to his place.
           They took him out on the patio of his
           apartment, threw his ass over the balcony.
           Nigger fell four stories. They had this
           garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
           like one of them greenhouses – nigger fell
           through that. Since then, he's kinda
           developed a speech impediment.
The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.
                       VINCENT
           That's a damn shame.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING
STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline
down the hall.
                       VINCENT
           Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya
           get burned.
                       JULES
           Whaddya mean?
                       VINCENT
           You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
           new bride a foot massage.
                       JULES
           You don't think he overreacted?
                       VINCENT
           Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to
           react like he did, but he had to expect a
           reaction.
                      JULES
           It was a foot massage, a foot massage is
           nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.
                       VINCENT
           It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's
           new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad
           as eatin' her out – no, but you're in the
           same fuckin' ballpark.
Jules stops Vincent.
           JULES
           Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there.
           Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a
           foot massage ain't even the same fuckin'
           thing.
                       VINCENT
           Not the same thing, the same ballpark.
                       JULES
           It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe
           your method of massage differs from mine,
           but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin'
           your tongue in her holyiest of holyies,
           ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same
           league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
           Foot massages don't mean shit.
                       VINCENT
           Have you ever given a foot massage?
                       JULES
           Don't be tellin' me about foot massages –
           I'm the foot fuckin' master.
                       VINCENT
           Given a lot of 'em?
                       JULES
           Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I
           don't tickle or nothin'.
                       VINCENT
           Have you ever given a guy a foot massage?
Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.
                       JULES
           Fuck you.
He starts walking down the hall.Vincent, smiling, walks a little
bit behind.
                       VINCENT
           How many?
                       JULES
           Fuck you.
                       VINCENT
           Would you give me a foot massage – I'm
           kinda tired.
                       JULES
           Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' pissed
           – this is the door.
The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49."They whisper.
                       JULES
           What time is it?
                       VINCENT
                    (checking his watch)
           Seven-twenty-two in the morning.
                       JULES
           It ain't quite time, let's hang back.
They move a little away from the door, facing each other, still
whispering
                       JULES
           Look, just because I wouldn't give no man
           a foot massage, don't make it right for
           Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building
           into a glass-motherfuckin-house, fuckin'
           up the way the nigger talks. That ain't
           right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he
           better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a
           motherfucker.
                       VINCENT
           I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're
           sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing,
           and I'm sayin' it does. I've given a
           million ladies a million foot massages and
           they all meant somethin'. We act like they
           don't, but they do. That's what's so
           fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual
           thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin
           about, but you know
           it and she knows it, fuckin'Marsellus knew
           it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin'
           better. That's his fuckin' wife, man. He
           ain't gonna have a sense of humor about
           that shit.
                       JULES
           That's an interesting point, but let's get
           into character.
                       VINCENT
           What's her name again?
                       JULES
           Mia. Why you so interested in big man's
           wife?
                      VINCENT
           Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and
           when he's gone, he wants me to take care
           of Mia.
                       JULES
           Take care of her?
Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.
                       VINCENT
           Not that! Take her out. Show her a good
           time. Don't let her get lonely.
                       JULES
           You're gonna be takin'MIA Wallace out on a
           date?
                       VINCENT
           It ain't a date. It's like when you and
           your buddy's wife go to a movie or
           somethin'. It's just... you know... good
           company.
Jules just looks at him.
                       VINCENT
           It's not a date.
Jules just looks at him.
INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING
THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a table
with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.
One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to REVEAL
Jules and Vincent in the hallway.
                       JULES
           Hey kids.
The two men stroll inside.
The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:
MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the scene
progresses, back into the corner.
ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of Seagulls"
haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the table with a big
sloppy hamburger in his hand.
BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.
Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in their
pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.
                         JULES
             How you boys doin'?
No answer.
                         JULES
                       (to Brett)
             Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a
             question.
                         BRETT
             We're doin' okay.
As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.
                         JULES
             Do you know who we are?
Brett shakes his head: "No."
                         JULES
             We're associates of your business partner
             Marsellus Wallace, you remember your
             business partner dont'ya?
No answer.
                         JULES
                      (to Brett)
             Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
             you're Brett, right?
                           BRETT
             I'm Brett.
                         JULES
             I thought so. Well, you remember your
             business partner Marsellus Wallace,
             dont'ya Brett?
                         BRETT
             I remember him.
                         JULES
             Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent
             caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that.
             What'cha eatin'?
                           BRETT
             Hamburgers.
                         JULES
             Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
             nutritious breakfast. What kinda
             hamburgers?
                         BRETT
             Cheeseburgers.
                       JULES
           No, I mean where did you get'em?
           MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box,
           where?
                       BRETT
           Big Kahuna Burger.
                       JULES
           Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian
           burger joint. I heard they got some tasty
           burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how
           are they?
                       BRETT
           They're good.
                       JULES
           Mind if I try one of yours?
                       BRETT
           No.
                       JULES
           Yours is this one, right?
                       BRETT
           Yeah.
Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.
                       JULES
           Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
                    (to Vincent)
           Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?
                       VINCENT
           No.
Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.
                       JULES
           You wanna bite, they're real good.
                       VINCENT
           I ain't hungry.
                       JULES
           Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a
           try sometime. Me, I can't usually eat 'em
           'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian. Which
           more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I
           sure love the taste of a good burger.
                    (to Brett)
           You know what they call a Quarter Pounder
           with Cheese in France?
                       BRETT
           No.
                       JULES
           Tell 'em, Vincent.
                       VINCENT
           Royale with Cheese.
                       JULES
           Royale with Cheese, you know why they call
           it that?
                       BRETT
           Because of the metric system?
                       JULES
           Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a
           smart motherfucker, that's
           right. The metric system.
                    (he points to a fast food
                     drink cup)
           What's in this?
                       BRETT
           Sprite.
                       JULES
           Sprite, good, mind if I have some of your
           tasty beverage to wash this down with?
                       BRETT
           Sure.
Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.
                       JULES
           Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
                    (to Roger)
           You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what
           we're here for?
Roger nods his head: "Yes."
                       JULES
           Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince,
           where you got the shit hid.
                       MARVIN
           It's under the be –
                       JULES
           – I don't remember askin' you a goddamn
           thing.
                    (to Roger)
           You were sayin'?
                       ROGER
           It's under the bed.
Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out a
black snap briefcase.
                          VINCENT
           Got it.
Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see what's
inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent just stares
at it, transfixed.
                          JULES
           We happy?
No answer from the transfixed Vincent.
                          JULES
           Vincent!
Vincent looks up at Jules.
                          JULES
           We happy?
Closing the case.
                       VINCENT
           We're happy.
                       BRETT
                    (to Jules)
           Look, what's your name? I got his
           name'sVINCENT, but what's yours?
                       JULES
           My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' your
           ass outta this shit.
                       BRETT
           I just want you to know how sorry we are
           about how fucked up things got between us
           and Mr. Wallace. When we entered into this
           thing, we only had the best intentions –
As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger three
times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.
Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.
Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, but
he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.
                       JULES
                    (to Brett)
           Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
           concentration? I didn't mean to do that.
           Please, continue. I believe you were
           saying something about "best intentions."
Brett can't say a word.
                       JULES
           Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway.
           Well, let me retort. Would you describe
           for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like?
Brett still can't speak.
Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing the
only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits in a lone
chair before Jules like a political prisoner in front of an
interrogator.
                       JULES
           What country you from!
                       BRETT
                     (petrified)
           What?
                       JULES
           "What" ain't no country I know! Do they
           speak English in "What?"
                       BRETT
                     (near heart attack)
           What?
                       JULES
           English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-it?
                       BRETT
           Yes.
                       JULES
           Then you understand what I'm sayin'?
                       BRETT
           Yes.
                       JULES
           Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks
           like!
                       BRETT
                     (out of fear)
           What?
Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's cheek.
                       JULES
           Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" again!
           I dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker,
           say "What" one more goddamn time!
Brett is regressing on the spot.
                       JULES
           Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace

Brett does his best.
                       BRETT
           Well he's... he's... black –
                          JULES
           – go on!
                       BRETT
           ... and he's... he's... bald –
                       JULES
           – does he look like a bitch?!
                          BRETT
                        (without thinking)
           What?
Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his eyes
and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder
Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in the
chair.
                       JULES
           Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

                          BRETT
                        (in agony)
           No.
                       JULES
           Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a
           bitch?!

                        (in spasm)
           I didn't.
Now in a lower voice.
                       JULES
           Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 'im.
           You ever read the Bible, Brett?
                          BRETT
                        (in spasm)
           Yes.
                       JULES
           There's a passage I got memorized, seems
           appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel
           25:17. "The path of the righteous man is
           beset on all sides by the inequities of
           the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
           Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
           and good will, shepherds the weak through
           the valley of darkness, for he is truly
           his brother's keeper and the finder of
           lost children. And I will strike down upon
           thee with great vengeance and furious
           anger those who attempt to poison and
           destroy my brothers. And you will know my
           name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
           upon you."
The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting
Brett.

MEDIUM SHOT – BUTCH COOLIDGE

We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old
prizefighter.Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue high
school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is everybody's
boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds like a cross between
a gangster and a king.
                       MARSELLUS (O.S.)
           I think you're gonna find – when all this
           shit is over and done – I think you're
           gonna find yourself one smilin'
           motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right now
           you got ability. But painful as it may be,
           ability don't last. Now that's a hard
           motherfuckin' fact of life, but it's a
           fact of life your ass is gonna hafta git
           realistic about. This business is filled
           to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers
           who thought their ass aged like wine.
           Besides, even if you went all the way,
           what would you be? Feather-weight champion
           of the world. Who gives a shit? I doubt
           you can even get a credit card based on
           that.
A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front of
Butch. Butch picks it up.
                      MARSELLUS (O.S.)
           Now the night of the fight, you may fell a
           slight sting, that's pride fuckin' wit ya.
           Fuck pride! Pride only hurts, it never
           helps. Fight through that shit. 'Cause a
           year from now, when you're kickin' it in
           the Caribbean you're gonna say, "Marsellus
           Wallace was right."
                       BUTCH
           I got no problem with that.
                       MARSELLUS (O.S.)
           In the fifth, your ass goes down.
Butch nods his head: "yes."
                          MARSELLUS (O.S.)
           Say it!
                       BUTCH
           In the fifth, my ass goes down
                                                     CUT TO:
INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY

Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 cherry-
red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, ROCKABILLY MUSIC
PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.
EXT. SALLY LeROY'S – DAY
Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bat by LAX that Marsellus owns.
Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking lot and
parks next to a white Honda Civic.
Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,
revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside:ENGLISH DAVE. Dave
isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin Park,
who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally LeRoy's.
                       ENGLISH DAVE
           Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, git
           your ass on in here.
Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between
Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door in
our faces.
INT. SALLY LeROY'S – DAY
The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave crosses
to the bar, and Vince follows.
                       VINCENT
           Where's the big man?
                       ENGLISH DAVE
           He's over there, finishing up some
           business.
VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with his back
to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of yet still UNSEEN
Marsellus.
                       ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
           Hand back for a second or two, and when
           you see the white boy leave, go on over.
           In the meanwhile, can I make you an
           espresso?
                       VINCENT
           How 'bout a cup of just plain ol'
           American?
                       ENGLISH DAVE
           Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia out
           tomorrow?
                       VINCENT
           At Marsellus' request.
           ENGLISH DAVE
           Have you met Mia?
                       VINCENT
           Not yet.
English Dave smiles to himself.
                       VINCENT
           What's so funny?
                       ENGLISH DAVE
           Not a goddamn thing.
                       VINCENT
           Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's
           fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a
           table, chew my food with my mouth closed,
           laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm
           gonna do.
English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.
                       ENGLISH DAVE
           My name's Paul, and this is between y'all.
Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his cup of
"Plain ol' American."
                       BUTCH
                    (to English Dave)
           Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?
                       ENGLISH DAVE
           Filters?
                       BUTCH
           Non.
While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his coffee,
staring at him. Butch looks over at him.
                       BUTCH
           Lookin' at somethin', friend?
                       VINCENT
           I ain't your friend, palooka.
Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.
                       BUTCH
           What was that?
                       VINCENT
           I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.
Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...
                       MARSELLUS (O.S.)
           Vincent Vega has entered the building, git
           your ass over here!
Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another
glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,
looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching business.
BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure that
is Marsellus.
Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend of
Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.
                       ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
           Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.
Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays English
Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT
CLOSEUP – JODY
A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of her
ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in her lips,
eyebrows and nose
                       JODY
           ... I'll lend it to you. It's a great book
           on body piercing.
Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen
table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is at
the same table, he's not included in the conversation.
                       TRUDI
           You know how they use that gun when they
           pierce your ears? They don't use that when
           they pierce your nipples, do they?
                      JODY
           Forget that gun. That gun goes against the
           entire idea behind piercing. All of my
           piercing, sixteen places on my body, every
           one of 'em done with a needle. Five in
           each ear. One through the nipple on my
           left breast. One through my right nostril.
           One through my left eyebrow. One through
           my lip. One in my clit. And I wear a stud
           in my tongue.
Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear and
out the other, until that last remark.
                       VINCENT
                    (interrupting)
           Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm
           curious, why would you get a stud in your
           tongue?
Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious thing in
the world.
                       JODY
           It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.
That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it makes
sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent to ponder
the truth of her statement.
                       LANCE (O.S.)
           Vince, you can come in now!
INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT
Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly appearance
that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly personality. LANCE
has been selling drugs his entire adult life. He's never had a day
job, never filed a tax return and has never been arrested. He
wears a red flannel shirt over a "Speed Racer" tee-shirt.
Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.
Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.
                       LANCE
           Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very good
           stuff. This is Bava, different, but
           equally good. And this is Choco from the
           Hartz Mountains of Germany. Now the first
           two are the same, forty-five an ounce –
           those are friend prices – but this one...
                    (pointing to the Choco)
           ... this one's a little more expensive.
           It's fifty-five. But when you shoot it,
           you'll know where that extra money went.
           Nothing wrong with the first two. It's
           real, real, real, good shit. But this
           one's a fuckin' madman.
                       VINCENT
           Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.
                       LANCE
           Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood? No.
           You're in my house. White people who know
           the difference between good shit and bad
           shit, this is the house they come to. My
           shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with
           Amsterdam shit any ol' day of the fuckin'
           week.
                       VINCENT
           That's a bold statement.
                       LANCE
           This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a
           seller's market. Coke is fuckin' dead as
           disco. Heroin's comin' back in a big
           fuckin' way. It's this whole seventies
           retro. Bell bottoms, heroin, they're as
           hot as hell.
Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse to
death.
                       VINCENT
           Give me three hundred worth of the madman.
           If it's as good as you say, I'll be back
           for a thousand.
                       LANCE
           I just hope I still have it. Whaddya think
           of Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend, wanna
           hand out an' get high?
                       VINCENT
           Which one's Trudi? The one with all the
           shit in her face?
                       LANCE
           No, that's Jody. That's my wife.
Vincent and Lance giggle at the "faux pas."
                       VINCENT
           I'm on my way somewhere. I got a dinner
           engagement. Rain check?
                         LANCE
           No problem?
Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting
up).
                       VINCENT
           You don't mind if I shoot up here?
                       LANCE
           Me casa, su casa.
                       VINCENT
           Mucho gracias.
Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two continue
to talk, Vince shoots up.
                       LANCE
           Still got your Malibu?
                       VINCENT

           Oh man, that's fucked up.
                       VINCENT
           Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing
           in storage three years. It's out five
           fuckin' days – five days, and some
           dickless piece of shit fucks with it.
                       LANCE
           They should be fuckin' killed. No trial,
           no jury, straight to execution.
As he cooks his heroin...
                       VINCENT
           I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya
           know? Oh man, I'd give anything to catch
           'em doin' it. It'a been worth his doin'

           Okay.

A video screen with an image of Vincent, walking. The Dusty
Springfield song continues.
Mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video camera
in Marcellus' living room.

then pours it into a glass.

Vincent ips the drink and looks at a portrait of Mia on the wall
Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record. The
Dusty Springfield song stops.

           Let's go.
EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT
In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over L.A.,
giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're all
basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, Golden
Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, saucy
waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the Fats Domino
Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelette, and over prices that
pay for all this bullshit.
But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's diners.
Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of view.
Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with a
neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red
windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath the cartoon
is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that is the
slogan:"Next best thing to a time machine."
                       VINCENT
           What the fuck is this place?
                       MIA
           This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis man
           should love it.
                       VINCENT
           Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.
                       MIA
           You can get a steak here, daddy-o. Don't
           be a...
Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on the
screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.
                       VINCENT
           After you, kitty-cat.
INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT
Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over the wall
("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF THE CRAB
MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that the patrons
sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars.
In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign on
the wall states, "No shoes allowed."So wannabe beboppers (actually
Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet.
The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, B & W
movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The WAITRESSES and
WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: MARILYN MONROE,
ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and LEWIS, and THE PHILIP
MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes.
Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red '59
Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting a big
button on his chest that says:"Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing you please
me."
                       BUDDY
           Hi I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?
                       VINCENT
           I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
                       BUDDY
           How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, or
           bloody as hell?
                       VINCENT
           Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla
           coke.
